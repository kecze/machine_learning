My machine learning projects. 

1. Terrain type recognition. (CNN) Project aiming to create models for terrain type recognition on satellite images (SAR and optical) with comparison to the basic referential models. Dataset taken form kaggle.
2. Shrel script generator. (LSTM) Model generating shrek new shrek script from the original given one.
